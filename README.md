  # Usage
  To make use of the program you need to have a text file in the same folder


              The text file must contain your video script and with the words that you need
              to add in the b roll, for example if you need to show a tiger photo in the
              b roll clip you just need to surround the word tiger with !(i.e !tiger!)
              so tiger b roll clip will be added 
  # Example

  Let's say script.txt is the file that you need to pass to this program

              The !text! file must contain your video script and with the !words! that you need
              to add in the b roll, 

              for example if you need to show a tiger photo in the
              b roll clip you just need to surround the word tiger with !(i.e !tiger!)
              so tiger b roll clip will be added 
  <br />
  So the word surrounded with the '!' Will be taken as the keyword and a b roll picture of that keyword will be added to the clip
